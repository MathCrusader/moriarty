A bunch of test files to read in.

The filenames try to describe what is in the file rather than a description of the underlying graph. This allows us to use the same file for multiple graph types.

E.g., `matrix_sym_binary_1diag.in` means it is a symmetric matrix representation containing only binary values, and the 1 means there are non-zeros on the diagonal.

`list_[pair|trips]_[1to5]_[are there loops]_[are there parallel edges]`
